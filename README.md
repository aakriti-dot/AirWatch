The Air Quality and Traffic Monitoring (AQI) project is a comprehensive initiative designed to offer valuable insights into air quality, traffic conditions, and meteorological parameters within the Los Angeles area. The project caters to the needs of city officials from the Traffic and Air Quality Monitoring Department and the general public. It integrates data from Purple Air sensors for AQI measurements, traffic data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, and meteorological data for a thorough analysis.

The rough diagram/ wireframe of the dashboard looks like : 

The first page AQI Analysis shows the AQI and the time spent.
